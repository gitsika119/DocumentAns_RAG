# Document Answering Program with RAG
<b>Summary:</b>
<p>The user (you) will ask a question about Messi. The program will first use RAG to get the most relevant material from the messi.txt file to answer the question. Then the program will then incorporate the results from RAG into a prompt into ChatGPT and the LLM will give a response to the question (and hopefully its more accurate using RAG).</p>
<b>Instructions:</b>
<p>/nDownload messi.txt and upload it before running the code. You'll also have to use your own OpenAI API key</p>
